# Humanoid Robot Walking Algorithm

## Introduction
This document outlines the walking algorithm for a humanoid robot controlled by six servo motors. The algorithm ensures smooth and coordinated movement, mimicking a natural walking motion.

## Walking Motion Breakdown
The walking motion consists of a series of sequential movements that simulate human-like gait. The key phases of the walking cycle are:

1. **Initial Position:**
   - All servos are set to their neutral position (90°) as a starting point.

2. **Step Forward (Right Leg):**
   - Lift the right leg by adjusting the hip and knee servos.
   - Move the right leg forward.
   - Lower the right leg to the ground.

3. **Shift Weight to Right Leg:**
   - Slightly tilt the torso to balance on the right leg.

4. **Step Forward (Left Leg):**
   - Lift the left leg by adjusting the hip and knee servos.
   - Move the left leg forward.
   - Lower the left leg to the ground.

5. **Shift Weight to Left Leg:**
   - Slightly tilt the torso to balance on the left leg.

6. **Repeat Steps 2-5 for Continuous Walking.**

## Pseudocode for Walking Algorithm
```plaintext
Start
Set all servos to 90° (neutral position)
Loop:
    Lift right leg (adjust hip & knee servos)
    Move right leg forward
    Lower right leg to ground
    Shift weight to right leg
    
    Lift left leg (adjust hip & knee servos)
    Move left leg forward
    Lower left leg to ground
    Shift weight to left leg
Repeat loop for continuous walking
End
```

## Considerations for Smooth Motion
- Ensure **gradual angle adjustments** to avoid jerky movements.
- Maintain **center of gravity** to prevent tipping over.
- Adjust **servo speed** to create a realistic walking pace.
- Implement **delay intervals** to synchronize movements effectively.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **sensor feedback** to adjust balance dynamically.
- Add **speed control** to vary walking pace.
- Integrate **obstacle detection** for autonomous navigation.

This algorithm provides the foundation for humanoid walking motion. Further refinements and optimizations can be applied based on real-world testing.
